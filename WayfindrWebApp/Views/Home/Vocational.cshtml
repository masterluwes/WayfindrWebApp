            <p class="vocational-education">
                Vocational education focuses on practical, skills-based training designed to prepare students for specific
                careers, trades, or technical occupations. <br /><br />Rather than following a traditional academic path,
                vocational learners are immersed in real-world tasks that simulate the duties they’ll perform in the
                workplace. This makes it an ideal route for individuals who prefer hands-on learning over theory-heavy
                lectures.
            </p>
            <div class="overlap-group">
                <p class="p">Programs are short (often under a year), meaning you can earn and gain experience quickly.</p>

                    If you’re more comfortable doing than studying theory, vocational paths are ideal.

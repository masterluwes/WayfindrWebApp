            <p class="a-gap-year-provides">
                A gap year provides a valuable space for personal growth and clarity, especially for those unsure of their
                next steps. During this time, individuals can engage in volunteer work, travel, internships, or part-time
                jobs—each offering lessons that traditional paths may not provide. <br /><br />Far from being a setback, a
                well-spent gap year can strengthen self-awareness, maturity, and purpose, leading to more confident and
                informed decisions moving forward.
